title: Breaking Anonymity at Scale
---

What does it take to re-identify 100,000 “anonymous” users?

In our latest [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05611), we show that anonymized human mobility data isn't as safe as it seems. By leveraging subtle patterns in location density, movement structure, and temporal activity, we were able to reverse-engineer real trajectories of users at a national scale in Japan.

Our findings demonstrate that even carefully anonymized datasets can retain enough signal to compromise user privacy. This work calls for a serious rethink of how we release and protect spatio-temporal data in the public domain.
