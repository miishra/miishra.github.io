title: "StateFi: Fingerprinting Wi-Fi Devices using State Machines"
---

Randomized MAC addresses are widely deployed to prevent passive Wi-Fi
device tracking. However, real-world devices still emit structured
behavioral patterns in management traffic that persist across sessions
and environments.

In **StateFi: Effectively Identifying Wi-Fi Devices through State
Transitions**, we show that device behavior itself forms a powerful
fingerprinting side channel, even when explicit identifiers are
aggressively randomized.

## Motivation

Most prior Wi-Fi fingerprinting techniques rely on syntactic features
such as Information Elements (IEs), sequence numbers (SEQ), or RSSI
correlations. These approaches degrade in dense environments and fail
under strong randomization, as they overlook the underlying logic of
device behavior.

## Behavioral modeling

StateFi models each device's activity as a **finite-state machine
(FSM)** that captures:

-   structural transition patterns
-   temporal execution dynamics

The resulting FSMs are embedded into compact feature vectors enabling
scalable similarity measurement and supervised classification.

## Key results

Across five heterogeneous campus environments and large public datasets,
StateFi achieves:

-   **94-97% accuracy** for in-network fingerprinting using full
    management-frame FSMs
-   **Up to 97% re-identification** under MAC randomization using
    probe-only FSMs
-   **98% discrimination accuracy**, outperforming prior signatures by
    up to **17 percentage points**

## Why it matters

StateFi reveals that randomized identifiers alone are insufficient for
privacy protection. Behavioral dynamics in Wi-Fi traffic are stable,
distinctive, and resilient to existing defenses, forming a persistent
and largely unmitigated tracking channel.
