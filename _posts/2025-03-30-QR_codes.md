title: Think Before You Scan QR codes
---

QR codes are pervasive in modern digital interactions, but despite their convenience, they pose significant privacy risks that are often underestimated. For instance, privacy issues escalate when scanned URLs trigger HTTP redirections involving QR URL shorteners and third-party domains, exposing user data to external entities. However, a comprehensive study of the privacy implications of QR code interactions concerning cookie exploitation and query strings remains lacking in the literature. 

To address this, we collected a dataset of 860 QR codes over a two-year period from France, China, Austria, India, and Canada, to analyze the privacy risks associated with QR code usage. 
In this paper, [QRisk](https://hal.science/hal-04987069/), we find that 39.2% of redirected URLs set cookies, including tracking, analytics, and advertising cookies, enabling potential cross-session behavioral profiling. 
Additionally, over 25% of QR URLs embed query strings that not only contain sensitive user identifiers but also carry information such as location data, leading to user profiling and social link inference.
