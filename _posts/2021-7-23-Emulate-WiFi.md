title: Record-and-replay to emulate WiFi
---

With growing privacy concerns over the last decade, two of the most notable wireless technologies – i.e., 
BLE and WiFi – are being more and more investigated in terms of privacy vulnerabilities. 

In this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9524956), we explore this problem, prospect the 
related consequences, and alert the need for privacypreserving public packets. We identify key flaws in the 
current design of public packets like  beacons and probe requests. We discuss them as the cause of privacy 
issues that require the community’s attention. 

We address the flaws in detail and propose solutions that facilitate the devices to protect user
privacy. We also give recommendations based on the findings to the standard.
