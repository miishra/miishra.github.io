title: Drafting DNS Security and Privacy Guidelines
---

How should DNS work for billions of IoT devicesâ€”and how do we ensure it does so securely and privately?

Our latest Internet-Draft tackles exactly this question. Co-authored with colleagues from Inria, UCL, and Infoblox, the draft outlines **best current practices** for IoT device manufacturers and network operators to mitigate DNS-related security and privacy risks at scale.

Despite being small and often unattended, IoT devices make frequent DNS queriesâ€”typically in predictable ways. This behavior exposes them (and the networks they live on) to fingerprinting, data leakage, and operational inefficiencies. Our document, titled *"IoT DNS Security and Privacy Guidelines"*, provides concrete, actionable recommendations:

- Compliance with encrypted DNS standards (DoH/DoT)  
- Source port and transaction ID randomization  
- Proper handling of TTLs  
- Resilience in failure conditions  
- DNSSEC adoption when feasible  

This is a **call for discussion and feedback** from the community. The draft is currently under review in the IETF IoT Operations (iotops) working group, and we welcome your thoughts, use cases, or operational insights.

Letâ€™s work together to shape a more secure and private DNS future for IoT.
